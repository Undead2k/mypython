# Move Files
Files:
- mf.exe - python script compiled into an exe file using "PyInstaller". This is for those who do not have python installed.
- mf.py - source code

What does it do?
- It is super simple. It copys files from all subfolders of a root directory, to the root directory.

Useage:
- mf.exe takes 1 argument - root directory (c:\folder1)
- "mf.exe c:\folder1"
